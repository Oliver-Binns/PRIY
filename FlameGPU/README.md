# FLAME GPU Simulation

[FlameGPU](https://www.github.com/FlameGPU/FlameGPU.git) has been used to implement a parallel GPU-based simulation of Peyer's Patch development.

The domain and platform models for this simulation has been developed using the [CoSMoS](https://www.cosmos-research.org) process, and are detailed [here](https://www.york.ac.uk/computational-immunology/software/ppsim/).
